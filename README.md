# 👋 Hi, I'm Veronica (PollinatorBee)  

💻 **Junior Fullstack Developer** | Web Applications & Virtual Reality 

---

## 🌱 About Me  
I’m a junior fullstack developer with a background in **Web Application Development** and a specialization in **Video Games and Virtual Reality**.  

I’ve worked on both the **frontend** (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Firebase) and **backend** (C#, .NET, SQL) sides of development, building responsive web apps and immersive VR experiences.  

During my internship at **Tracasa Instrumental**, I collaborated on maintaining internal .NET applications using **Visual Studio, C#, and AngularJS**, and supported integration and testing tasks in an Agile team environment.  

I’m passionate about **clean, maintainable code**, user-centered design, and learning modern technologies such as **React, Next.js, and ASP.NET Core**.  
I also hold a **C1 English certification (Cambridge CAE)** and enjoy working in international, collaborative environments.
